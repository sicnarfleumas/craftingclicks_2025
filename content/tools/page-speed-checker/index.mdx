NOTE: The page speed checker is currently in beta and may not work as expected. We are working on it and will be adding more features soon.

## Understanding Your Page Speed Results

Our Page Speed Checker provides comprehensive insights into your website's performance across multiple dimensions. Here's how to interpret and make the most of your results:

### Core Web Vitals

The tool analyzes three critical metrics that Google uses to evaluate your website's user experience:

1. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**
   - Measures loading performance
   - Target: Under 2.5 seconds for a good user experience
   - Shows when your main content has loaded

2. **First Input Delay (FID)**
   - Measures interactivity
   - Target: Under 100 milliseconds
   - Indicates how quickly your site responds to user interactions

3. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**
   - Measures visual stability
   - Target: Under 0.1
   - Helps identify unexpected layout shifts

## Performance Metrics

The detailed performance breakdown includes:

- **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**: Initial server response time
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: When the first content appears
- **Speed Index**: How quickly content is visually displayed
- **Total Blocking Time**: Impact of scripts on interactivity

## Why Page Speed Matters

Website speed is crucial for several reasons:

- **User Experience**: Faster sites provide a better user experience, reducing bounce rates and increasing engagement
- **SEO Rankings**: Google uses page speed as a ranking factor, especially on mobile
- **Conversion Rates**: Faster sites typically have higher conversion rates
- **Mobile Performance**: With most traffic coming from mobile devices, speed is essential for mobile users

## Common Speed Issues and Solutions

### Render-Blocking Resources

**Problem**: JavaScript and CSS files that block the rendering of your page.

**Solution**: Defer non-critical JavaScript, inline critical CSS, and use async loading where appropriate.

### Image Optimization

**Problem**: Large, unoptimized images slow down page loading.

**Solution**: Compress images, use modern formats like WebP, implement lazy loading, and serve appropriately sized images.

### Server Response Time

**Problem**: Slow server response increases Time to First Byte (TTFB).

**Solution**: Upgrade hosting, implement caching, use a CDN, and optimize database queries.

### Excessive JavaScript

**Problem**: Heavy JavaScript slows down parsing, execution, and interactivity.

**Solution**: Reduce unnecessary code, split code into smaller chunks, and defer non-critical scripts.

## Making Use of the Data

To get the most value from your speed test results:

1. **Focus on Core Web Vitals First**
   - These metrics directly impact your SEO and user experience
   - Prioritize fixing any metrics in the "poor" or "needs improvement" range

2. **Review Network Requests**
   - Look for large files that can be optimized
   - Identify render-blocking resources
   - Check for compression opportunities

3. **Implement Recommendations**
   - Start with critical issues
   - Address important improvements systematically
   - Document changes and retest regularly

4. **Monitor Over Time**
   - Run regular tests to track improvements
   - Compare mobile and desktop performance
   - Watch for performance regressions

Remember, website optimization is an ongoing process. Regular testing and monitoring help maintain optimal performance as your site evolves.
